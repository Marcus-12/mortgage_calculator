A mortgage calculator is a simple tool that helps you estimate your monthly home loan payments. By entering the loan amount, interest rate, and repayment period, it quickly calculates how much you’ll pay each month, including interest. It’s useful for planning your budget and understanding what you can afford before applying for a home loan.
